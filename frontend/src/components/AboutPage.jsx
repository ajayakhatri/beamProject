              Purpose: The application is designed for modeling and analyzing
              beam structures.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Analysis Method: It employs the finite element method for
              structural analysis. This method involves dividing the beam into
              several finite elements.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Element Division: The beam is divided into finite elements
                  such that their maximum length is set to 0.05 times the total
                  length of the beam. This factor of 0.05 can be easily modified
                  in the views.py file.

                <p>
                  Degrees of Freedom: Each nodes of beam element is considered
                  to have two degrees of freedom. These are described as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Rotation about the normal to the plane of the model (RZ).
                  </li>
                  <li>Translation in the vertical direction (UY).</li>

          </li>

          It was developed as a final project for CS50W, using React as frontend
          Javascript library, Django as backend Python framework and NumPy for
          calculation. Frontend sends data of a beam model to the backend via an
          HTTP request, and there is a Django model for handling the read and
          write operations of beam data in the database. Click{" "}

        <p>
          I, as a recent civil engineering graduate, always had the affinity for
          structural analysis and wanted my CS50W final project to be related to
          enginnering itself. I googled and found that the existing beam apps on
          the internet were not very fun to use, they need more interactivity.
          And thus, I began my journey by learning React and NumPy.

          The Beam Calculator App stands out due to its combination of
          interactive modeling thanks to <strong>React</strong>, a javascript
          library and analysis of modelled beam in{" "}
          <strong>Django backend</strong> by{" "}
          <strong>Finite Element Method</strong> with the use of NumPy, a python
          library. Features like onboarding guide, save, load and print are plus
          points to this web project. The web app is{" "}
          <strong>mobile responsive</strong> as well. The distinctiveness are
          mentioned below:

              The frontend and backend are separated, that means the user can
              change method of analysis in backend to any methods while using
              the beautiful frontend as it is.

              For optimal printing, it may be necessary to adjust the dimensions
              of the PDF. While testing on desktops using Edge and Chrome, the
              print was satisfactory.
